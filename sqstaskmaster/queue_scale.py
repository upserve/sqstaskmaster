    Runnable Task to monitor SQS queue depth and adjust the number of ECS service works.
    Based on declarative rules for queues, services and clusters.
    Current implementation provides only an all on, or all off approach, setting the number of works to ACTIVE_SIZE or
    zero. Tasks should be evenly distributed between workers assuming the number of workers is much smaller than the
    number of tasks. The tail as workers run out of work tasks is ignored.

            SERVICE_NAME: "{ECS_SERVICE_NAME}",
